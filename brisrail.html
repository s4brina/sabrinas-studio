    Brisbane Rail UI
</h1>
        <p class="job_text">
            In 2022, I created a user interface for a hypothetical service where tax-payers were given the opportunity to decide where the money spent on Brisbane Rail is invested towards. To create the fully functioning prototype, I used Figma, and this can be interacted with below.
        <br><br>
        We had to consider a range of elements, such as the accessibility of the interface, how categories were sorted, and the overall flow of the program. We also created a document that explained the process and our design decisions, and this can be accessed here.

        My main role was to maintain the NFIA Wordpress site which involved ensuring plugins were updated, ensuring search optimisation and creating posts/articles/new web pages. I was also responsible for the health of the website, as well as some social media maintenance. I used active campaign in order to keep track of customers and create marketing campaigns and send out emails. I also created promotional videos for NFIA, including motion graphics for logos and general video editing.
